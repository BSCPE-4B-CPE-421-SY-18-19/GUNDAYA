Quiz 1



Why does the Raspberry Pi functioning?



The Raspberry Pi microcomputer is functioning because an operating system is installed- which is highly needed to make it functional. Also, the computer system is properly connected to the power source. As an indication of a well-functioning Raspberry Pi microcomputer, two Light Emitting Diodes are mounted on its board. A blinking green LED is for the operating system and a red LED for the power supply. As we run the system, the two LEDs functioned well. Thus, the microcomputer is in good condition.

Why does the computer system did not function?



We found out that the fuse inside the PSU has blown. For this reason, the power supply did not function which causes us the inability to check the other parts of the computer system.



Possible solutions are:



1. Replace the fuse of the power supply.

2. Replace the power supply.
